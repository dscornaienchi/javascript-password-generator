# Password Generator Starter Code

## Description

This webpage use JavaScript to allow the end user to randomly generate a password. The starter code included the HTML and CSS elements, but was not properly following the acceptance criteria. I've summarized below how this website is designed to operate: 


* WHEN I click the button to generate a password, THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria, WHERE I select which criteria to include the password 
    * Length (8 to 128 characters)
    * Character types (lowercase,uppercase,special characters) - It is required to select at least 1 of the 3 types
* WHEN all prompts are answered, THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria, and is written to the page for consumption
